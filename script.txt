This happened a few years ago, when I was 18 and my cousin was 16.
It was around 2 in the morning. We were hanging out at my place, just talking, watching random YouTube videos, the usual. At some point we both got hit with that late-night hunger that only teenagers know the kind where chips and soda suddenly feel like the most important mission in the world.

The supermarket wasn’t far, maybe a few blocks, and normally we’d just walk along the street. But between my house and the store, there’s a patch of dense woods that cuts right through the neighborhood. It’s not massive, but big enough that if you go straight through, it saves you maybe ten minutes. We’d done it before, even at night, so it didn’t feel like a big deal.

So, we grabbed some hoodies, put our hoods up against the cold, and started walking. The woods at that hour felt different though. The streetlights don’t reach into them, and once you’re a few steps in, the glow of the neighborhood behind you fades fast. It’s not pitch black, but it’s the kind of darkness where your eyes are always guessing at shapes. The air felt heavy, and the only real sound was the crunch of our sneakers on the dirt path.

About halfway through, that’s when it happened.

We both heard it something moving in the bushes to our right. At first I figured it was just an animal, maybe a raccoon or a stray dog. But the sound didn’t stop. It wasn’t the quick scamper of something running away it was deliberate. Like it was waiting.

I turned toward the sound, and that’s when I saw it. Something stepped out. Humanoid in shape, but the face.. God, the face was wrong. The bone structure looked like a cow’s skull, but stretched over something that still moved like a person. Long jaw, wide flat nose, hollow-looking eyes. It wasn’t some mask, it wasn’t a shadow it was real, and it was standing there, tilted slightly forward like it was ready to spring.

And then it did. It moved faster than anything I’ve ever seen. One second it was in the bushes, the next it was right in front of me, closing the distance in a flash. I swear I felt the air shift as it came at me. My body just reacted I spun and ran. Then my cousin screamed. That’s what really confirmed it wasn’t in my head. If it had just been me, maybe I could’ve convinced myself later that it was a trick of the dark. But we both saw it. We ran like hell, crashing through branches, stumbling on roots, just tearing ourselves out of those woods. My chest felt like it was going to explode, and all I could think was that it was behind us, just inches away, ready to grab me.

When we finally made it out onto the street and dared to look back, there was nothing. Just empty woods. No sound, no movement. Like it had never been there at all.

But the fear was real. The scream was real. The way it moved, that wasn’t human. It wasn’t an animal either. It was something else. We made it to the store eventually, but we barely spoke a word the entire way there. Neither of us wanted to be the first to say what we’d seen. Only later, when we were back home with the lights on, did my cousin look at me and say, “You saw that too, right?”
